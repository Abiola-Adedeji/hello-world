<h1> Queer Nigerians' Lives Matter</h1>
<p>"Nigeria is a cold-blooded country for queer people, and we have the scars to prove it"</p> <br>
<div>
<p> On January 7, 2014, Nigeria's former president, Goodluck Jonathan, signed the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act (SSMPA) into law.</p> <br>
<p> The notional purpose of the SSMPA is to prohibit marriage between persons of the same sex. In reality, the its scope is much wider. The law forbids any cohabitation between same-sex partners and bans "anypublic show of same sex amorous  relationship." The SSMPA imposes a 10-year prison sentence on anyone who "registers, operates, or participates in gay clubs, societies, and organizations" or "supports" the activities of such organizations.</p> <br>
<p> Punishments are severe, ranging from 10-14 years in prison</p> <br>
<p> Queer Nigerians are attacked, killed, harrased, kidnapped, kitoed, and denied access to certain amenities.</p> <br>
